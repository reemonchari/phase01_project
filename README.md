# Aircraft Risk Analysis for Aviation Business Expansion

## Overview
This project analyzes historical aviation accident data to help business stakeholders decide which aircraft types present the lowest operational and financial risk as the company expands into the aviation sector.

The analysis focuses on accident frequency, fatality rates, damage severity, and long‑term safety trends to support data‑driven aircraft acquisition decisions.

## Business Understanding

**Stakeholder**
- Head of the new Aviation Division

**Key Business Questions**
1. Which aircraft types have the lowest risk in terms of fatalities?
2. Which aircraft types tend to sustain the least damage in accidents?
3. Is aviation a viable long‑term investment based on historical safety trends?

## Data Understanding and Analysis

### Source of Data
- National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) aviation accident and incident dataset

### Description of Data
The dataset contains civil aviation accidents across multiple decades and includes:
- Accident date
- Aircraft type/model
- Operator
- Fatalities
- Damage severity
- Location

### Key Visualizations
1. **Average Fatalities by Aircraft Type**  
   Shows which aircraft models have consistently low or zero average fatalities.

2. **Average Damage Severity by Aircraft Type**  
   Highlights aircraft associated with minor damage versus substantial or destroyed damage.

3. **Accidents and Fatalities Over Time**  
   Demonstrates a long‑term decline in fatalities, indicating improved aviation safety.

(These same visualizations are presented in the notebook and non‑technical slide deck.)

## Conclusion

### Summary of Findings
1. Certain modern aircraft types (e.g., Airbus A320 family, Boeing 787) show consistently low fatality risk.
2. Aircraft with lower average damage severity reduce maintenance costs and operational downtime.
3. Long‑term trends show aviation safety has improved significantly, supporting business expansion.
